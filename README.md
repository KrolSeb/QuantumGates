:computer:
## A simple quantum calculation simulator, within the library scope:
* :bulb: quantum bit representations 
* :bulb: measuring the state
* :bulb: qubit reset 
* :bulb: validations 
* :bulb: normalization of qubit/register of qubits 
* :bulb: seeing the state of qubit without collapsing
